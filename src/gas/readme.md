I fetched all transactions for a given set of addresses, with the goal of computing the average gas cost for transactions. I removed the top 5 and bottom 5% for the compute.

----- Gas price stats (all addresses combined) -----
Total tx with gasPrice: 32561
Total tx with cost data: 32561
Trimmed average gas price (5% low & high removed):
- 1411438620 wei
- ≈ 1.41 gwei
- ≈ 0.000000001 Hype

Trimmed average transaction cost (5% low & high removed):
- 160511883439047 wei
- ≈ 0.000160512 Hype
